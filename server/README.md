# Inventory 
This is an Express website from [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application). Its the first project using Express and the requirments are pretty simple.  
## Requirments 
```
Your Inventory app should have categories and items, so when the user goes to the home-page they can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in that category. You should include all of the CRUD methods for both items and categories, so anybody thatâ€™s visiting the site can Create, Read, Update or Delete any Item or Category.
```

I did a grocery store type website and most of the categories like "Meats, Drinks, Dairy" were too broad so I made subcategories for specifity. Now Drinks has "Soda", "Sports Drinks", "Energy Drinks", and "Other" which could be expanded as needed.  All CRUD operations are there and organized into neat routes. 
### Other Information
This project has a lot of images included. I started by using a Google Images API but the limit was hit incredibly quick and not feasible. I wrote a script to query the database and download every image for the collections. If you are intrested in that it is in server/api/google_images.js. It was not perfect and I did not test it before using it but it did save me a ton of time. 
## How to run locally
